# Data-Driven Insights into EV Charger Station Performance

This project leverages Python's powerful data analysis capabilities to extract valuable insights from a large dataset (54,000 entries) of EV charger station usage. By employing statistical techniques and time series analysis, we aim to uncover trends, patterns, and correlations within the data. This analysis will provide actionable recommendations to optimize charger station operations, improve user experience, and inform future infrastructure planning.

- Time Series Analysis:
    Identify seasonal trends
    Detect anomalies or outliers that may indicate operational issues

- Evolution Over Time:
    Track changes in usage patterns over time (e.g., increasing or decreasing demand)
    Assess the impact of factors like new EV models or charging infrastructure expansion

- Correlation Matrix:
    Explore relationships between different variables (e.g., charger type, location, and usage)
    Identify factors that influence charging behavior and optimize station placement

By combining these techniques, we can gain a comprehensive understanding of EV charger station performance and make data-driven decisions to improve the overall charging experience.
